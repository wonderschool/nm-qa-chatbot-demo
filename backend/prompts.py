QUESTION: Do you offer part-time, extended hours, or backup care?
Yes. You can filter for programs that offer before and after school care as well as non-traditional hours by clicking on the “Program offerings” button in the finder then checking the appropriate boxes.
QUESTION: What types of programs are offered?
Parents can choose between home and center-based programs.

Center-based programs serve children ages 0 to up to 13 years, depending on the individual program, and is monitored by the Early Childhood Education and Care Department. Child Care providers are required to have background checks, building inspections, and basic training. Home-based child care providers have the option to become licensed or registered by the state. A child care center must be licensed by the state with the exception of certain religious or parent-based organizations. In these two settings, programs can also be Head Start or Early Head Start and New Mexico Pre-K.

Head Start and Early Head Start Centers are federally-funded non-residential settings, normally open during the school year only, and usually offer limited hours and sessions.
